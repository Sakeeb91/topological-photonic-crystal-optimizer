# Test configuration for MEEP simulations with reduced parameters for faster testing
# All length units are in micrometers (Âµm).

# 1. Physics & Geometry Parameters (The Search Space)
# Smaller search space for testing
design_space:
  a: [0.35, 0.40]      # 1st dimerization distance
  b: [0.10, 0.15]      # 2nd dimerization distance
  r: [0.14, 0.16]      # Hole radius
  R: [12.0, 14.0]      # Ring radius
  w: [0.48, 0.52]      # Waveguide width
